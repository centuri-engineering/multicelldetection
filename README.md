# Project Title
IDP30| DyNaMo | Measuring lipid bilayers height with accuracy 

# Project summary

Biological membranes, made up of lipid bilayers, play an essential role in many biological and chemical processes. Supported lipid bilayers are widely used as biomimetic models for studying them. They can be characterised by atomic force microscopy. This technique uses a fine tip to scan the surface of the sample and determine its topography. This enables the thickness of the lipid bilayer to be measured very precisely, on a nanometric scale. However, to avoid acquisition artefacts, the data must be pre-processed to allow thickness measurements. In particular, the angle between the probe and the surface during scanning induces a tilt in the image, which needs to be levelled. Most processing softwares offer algorithms for doing this, but this step can be really tricky, as the corrections can induce distortions. As lipid bilayers are very thin (few nanometers), any deviation is problematic.

# Requested task

The aim is therefore to develop a data processing routine that allows accurate, reproducible and automatable measurement of the thickness of the lidipid layers at each point in order to process a large number of images.
